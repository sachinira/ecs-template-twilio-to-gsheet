# Template: Twilio data to a Google Sheet
When new SMS is received to a Twilio account, update a cell in a Google Sheet.

There are day-to-day scenarios where we come across surveys or competitions which are initiated with the use of SMS voting. This integration template allows you to start such kind of scenario instantly and obtain the voting results with the use of a Google Sheet. It listens to the incoming Twilio SMS (with a predefined template) and increments a count in a Google Sheet. This can be used to update specific data in the Google Sheet.<br>

The practical use case we have implemented here is a scenario where `A survey to find out the best language for building microservices out of a set of given languages`.
The users have to send an SMS in the predefined format `Vote <Language Name>` to a given Twilio number. The template will update the count on each valid SMS receive.

## Use this template to
- Get the summary of a competition/survey initiated using Twilio SMS.

## What you need
- A Twilio Account
- A Google Cloud Platform Account

## Running the Template
1. First you need to build the integration template and create the executable binary. Run the following command from the 
root directory of the integration template. 
`$ bal build`. 

2. Then you can run the integration binary with the following command. 
`$  bal run target/bin/twilio_to_gsheet-0.1.1.jar`. 

3. Now you can send new messages in the format `Vote <LANGUAGE_NAME>` to the specific Twilio account and observe that 
integration template runtime has received the event notification upon receiving new message.

4. You can check the Google Sheet to verify that how the count of each language is increased in the specified sheet.
